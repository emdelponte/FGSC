**FGSCdb** is a database of information on characterized fungal strains of Fusarium graminearum species complex that encompasses a complex of species that cause head blight or scab of small grain crops, but also ear and stalk rot of maize and panicle blight in rice. Geographic information combined with the informaton on the year of sampling, it allows to track the temporal and spatial spread of the pathogen. All datasets and codes for are built using open source tools and are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/emdelponte/fgscdb). We would like to extend the utility of this project by allowing other researches to contribute data to populate the global map. Get in touch ([delponte\@ufv.br](mailto:delponte@ufv.br){.email}) to receive instructions on how to participate and include your data.
